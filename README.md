 ---------- Estimator pattern ----------
  
  In order to estimate how long a user can finish a chapter, I had to take into account several variables.
  For calculating the difficulty coefficient I used Gunning Fog Score, consists in applying a text or a paragraph with a lenght of about 100 - 200 words, from this paragraph we extract the exact number of words, number sentences, but also the number of complex words ( provided, they had to have 3 syllables or more, soo the words that have common prefixes and suffixes (eg "ing","ous" etc.) are eliminated ).
  To optimize the estimate in algorithm I also calculated the average time spent on each page.
